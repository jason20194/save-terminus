## Description of the application
This terminal application is a simple text based adventure game which allows the user to play through a storyline, making decisions by inputting the numbers they want. The scope of the idea is pretty simplistic and very much has the same similarity as most adventure games: the basic plot is there is an evil being which takes over the world and the player must stop him. The application is run using ruby, as it is written in ruby language.

## Identify the issue that it resolves
This application was made purely for entertainment. Therefore it does not resolve any real life scenarios or issues.

## Statement of Purpose and Scope
The reason why I made this game was because I wanted to see how far my knowledge of ruby can go. It has only been 2 weeks since I learnt ruby, so at the same time I wanted to refresh my mind by trying to create a terminal based game. To me learning by doing is the most efficient method of learning there can ever be, especially since im a pattern learner. This may not be a very hard or advanced terminal application, however it is very good knowing that I am able to write basic ruby. If I want to be able to make much more complex apps in the future, this can be considered very good practice in preparation for it.

## Target Audience
This Terminal application is primarily targetting kids since most kids loves games. However, it can also be very helpful to people of any age who are interested in learning about the fundamentals of Ruby. Because this is not a very high level project, people with very little experience can break down how the game is made, which will may also help solidify their ruby skills. Another mention is that this program was built on a MacOS, so primarily it is made for MacOS users. As of current there are no other versions so Windows users may have trouble running it on their PCs.

## How will the audience use it
If the audience wants to use this application, they should refer to the README file. It will explain what software is required to run the game. However, they should have VSCode and the gems installed, as that is the basics needed to get the game running.
